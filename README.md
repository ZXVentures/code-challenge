# ZX-Ventures Challenge

## Welcome to Zé Delivery!

You are in a barbecue with your friends having a nice time and the beer ran out! As everyone is already drinking and no one can drive to the next store, what you guys do? With [Zé Delivery](https://ze.delivery) you can order beers from your smartphone and receiving it in less than an hour, cold and ready to drink! Oh, and the price is the same you will find in the nearest market store. Cool, right? 

We believe everyone deserves to order a beer no matter where, how and when they want it. 

## Choose your challenge

So, in order to fulfill this vision and deliver this amazing experience to all our customers, we have an incredible team that is focused to deliver the best experience possible to our users. Working alongside with Product Managers and Designers, our Engineers and Scientists develop and maintain our tech stack, that must be robust, resilient and scalable (and also as simple as possible, right?).

# Data Science Challenge

## About the Challenge... 

*... Kaggle for the win!* 

To evaluate for ZÃ©'s `Data Science` positions, we kindly ask you to take a look at the following Kaggle challenge. There, you will find instructions in order to provide a solution to it: 

- https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting

### What you should provide us

We expect you to create a Kaggle notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/docs/kernels) with your solution, explaining how you approached the problem presented in the challenge. It is important to describe which decisions you have made and the rationale behind each. Also, you should explain how you cleaned and processed the data, which algorithms you have used, the strategy you applied on feature engineering and everything else you assume is important for us to understand your solution.

Good luck!
